.SH NAME
pdcp \- copy files to groups of hosts in parallel
.br
rpdcp \- (reverse pdcp) copy files from a group of hosts in parallel 

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpdcp\fR [\fIoptions\fR]... src [src2...] dest
.br
\fBrpdcp\fR [\fIoptions\fR]... src [src2...] dir

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpdcp\fR is a variant of the rcp(1) command.  Unlike rcp(1), which
copies files to a single remote host, \fBpdcp\fR can copy files to
multiple remote hosts in parallel.  However, \fBpdcp\fR does
not recognize files in the format ``rname@rhost:path,'' therefore all
source files must be on the local host machine.  Destination nodes must
be listed on the \fBpdcp\fR command line using a suitable target
nodelist option (See the \fIOPTIONS\fR section below).  Each destination
node listed must have \fBpdcp\fR installed for the copy to succeed.
.LP
When \fBpdcp\fR receives SIGINT (ctrl-C), it lists the status of current
threads.  A second SIGINT within one second terminates the program. Pending
threads may be canceled by issuing ctrl-Z within one second of ctrl-C.
Pending threads are those that have not yet been initiated, or are still
in the process of connecting to the remote host.
.LP 
Like pdsh(1), the functionality of \fBpdcp\fR may be supplemented by
dynamically loadable modules. In \fBpdcp\fR, the modules may provide
a new connect protocol (replacing the standard rsh(1) protocol), filtering
options (e.g. excluding hosts that are down), and/or host selection 
options (e.g. \fI-a\fR selects all nodes from a local config file). 
By default, \fBpdcp\fR requires at least one "rcmd" module to be
loaded (to provide the channel for remote copy).

.SH "REVERSE PDCP"
\fBrpdcp\fR performs a reverse parallel copy.  Rather than copying files 
to remote hosts, files are retrieved from remote hosts and stored locally.  
All directories or files retrieved will be stored with their remote
hostname appended to the filename.  The destination file must be a
directory when this option is used. 
.LP
In other respects, \fBrpdcp\fR is exactly like \fBpdcp\fR, and further 
statements regarding \fBpdcp\fR in this manual also apply to \fBrpdcp\fR.

.SH "RCMD MODULES"
The method by which \fBpdcp\fR connects to remote hosts may be
selected at runtime using the \fI-R\fR option (See \fIOPTIONS\fR below). 
This functionality is ultimately implemented via dynamically loadable
modules, and so the list of available options may be different
from installation to installation. A list of currently available rcmd 
modules is printed when using any of the \fI-h\fR, \fI-V\fR, or \fI-L\fR 
options. The default rcmd module will also be displayed with the
\fI-h\fR and \fI-V\fR options.
.LP
A list of \fIrcmd\fR modules currently distributed with \fBpdcp\fR     
follows.
.TP 8
rsh
Uses an internal, thread-safe implementation of BSD rcmd(3)
to run commands using the standard rsh(1) protocol.
.TP
ssh
Uses a variant of popen(3) to run multiple copies of the ssh(1)
command.
.TP
mrsh
This module uses the mrsh(1) protocol to execute jobs on remote hosts.
The mrsh protocol uses a credential based authentication, forgoing
the need to allocate reserved ports. In other aspects, it acts just
like rsh.
.TP
krb4
The krb4 module allows users to execute remote commands after
authenticating with kerberos. Of course, the remote rshd daemons
must be kerberized.
.TP
xcpu
The xcpu module uses the xcpu service to execute remote commands.

.SH OPTIONS
The list of available \fBpdcp\fR options is determined at runtime
by supplementing the list of standard \fBpdcp\fR options with
any options provided by loaded \fIrcmd\fR and \fImisc\fR modules.
In some cases, options provided by modules may conflict with
each other. In these cases, the modules are incompatible and
the first module loaded wins.

.SH "Standard target nodelist options"
.TP
\fB\-w\fR \fITARGETS,...\fR
Target and or filter the specified list of hosts. Do not use with any
other node selection options (e.g. \fI\-a\fR, \fI\-g\fR, if they are
available). No spaces are allowed in the comma-separated list.  Arguments in
the \fITARGETS\fR list may include normal host names, a range of hosts
in hostlist format (See \fBHOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS\fR), or a single `-'
character to read the list of hosts on stdin.

If a host or hostlist is preceded by a `-' character, this causes those
hosts to be explicitly excluded. If the argument is preceded by a single `^'
character, it is taken to be the path to file containing a list of hosts,
one per line. If the item begins with a `/' character, it is taken  as a
regular expression on which to filter the list of hosts (a regex argument
may also be optionally trailed by another '/', e.g.  /node.*/). A regex or
file name argument may also be preceeded by a minus `-' to exclude instead
of include thoses hosts.

A list of hosts may also be preceded by "user@" to specify a remote
username other than the default, or "rcmd_type:" to specify an alternate
rcmd connection type for these hosts. When used together, the rcmd type
must be specified first, e.g. "ssh:user1@host0" would use ssh to connect
to host0 as user "user1."


.TP
.I \fB-x\fR \fIhost,host,...\fR
Exclude the specified hosts. May be specified in conjunction with
other target node list options such as \fI\-a\fR and \fI\-g\fR (when
available). Hostlists may also be specified to the \fI\-x\fR option
(see the \fBHOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS\fR section below). Arguments to
\fI-x\fR may also be preceeded by the filename (`^') and regex ('/')
characters as described above, in which case the resulting hosts are excluded
as if they had been given to \fB\-w\fR and preceeded with the minus `-'
character.


.SH "Standard pdcp options"
.TP
.I "-h"
Output usage menu and quit. A list of available rcmd modules
will be printed at the end of the usage message.
.TP
.I "-q"
List option values and the target nodelist and exit without action.
.TP
.I "-b"
Disable ctrl-C status feature so that a single ctrl-C kills parallel
copy. (Batch Mode)
.TP
.I "-r"
Copy directories recursively.
.TP
.I "-p"
Preserve modification time and modes.
.TP
.I "-e PATH"
Explicitly specify path to remote \fBpdcp\fR binary
instead of using the locally executed path. Can also be set via
the environment variable PDSH_REMOTE_PDCP_PATH.
.TP
.I "-l user"
This option may be used to copy files as another user, subject to
authorization. For BSD rcmd, this means the invoking user and system must
be listed in the user\'s .rhosts file (even for root).
.TP
.I "-t seconds"
Set the connect timeout. Default is @CONNECT_TIMEOUT@ seconds.
.TP
.I "-f number"
Set the maximum number of simultaneous remote copies to \fInumber\fR.
The default is @FANOUT@.
.TP
.I "-R name"
Set rcmd module to \fIname\fR. This option may also be set via the
PDSH_RCMD_TYPE environment variable. A list of available rcmd
modules may be obtained via either the \fI-h\fR or \fI-L\fR options.
.TP
.I "-M name,..."
When multiple \fBmisc\fR modules provide the same options to \fBpdsh\fR,
the first module initialized "wins" and subsequent modules are not loaded.
The \fI-M\fR option allows a list of modules to be specified that will be
force-initialized before all others, in-effect ensuring that they load
without conflict (unless they conflict with eachother). This option may
also be set via the PDSH_MISC_MODULES environment variable.
.TP
.I "-L"
List info on all loaded \fBpdcp\fR modules and quit.
.TP
.I "-d"
Include more complete thread status when SIGINT is received, and display
connect and command time statistics on stderr when done.
.TP
.I "-V"
Output \fBpdcp\fR version information, along with list of currently
loaded modules, and exit.


.SH "HOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS"
As noted in sections above, 
.B pdcp 
accepts ranges of hostnames in
the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n < m and l < k, etc.,
as an alternative to explicit lists of hosts.  This form should not
be confused with regular expression character classes (also denoted
by ``[]''). For example, foo[19] does not represent foo1 or foo9, but
rather represents a degenerate range: foo19. 

This range syntax is meant
only as a convenience on clusters with a prefixNN naming convention and
specification of ranges should not be considered necessary -- the list
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range foo[1,9].

Some examples of range usage follow:

.nf

Copy /etc/hosts to foo01,foo02,...,foo05
    pdcp -w foo[01-05] /etc/hosts /etc

Copy /etc/hosts to foo7,foo9,foo10
    pdcp -w foo[7,9-10] /etc/hosts /etc

Copy /etc/hosts to foo0,foo4,foo5
    pdcp -w foo[0-5] -x foo[1-3] /etc/hosts /etc

.fi

As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ('['
and ']') for pattern matching.  Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.  For example, in
tcsh, the first example above should be executed as:

    pdcp -w "foo[01-05]" /etc/hosts /etc

.SH "ORIGIN"
Pdsh/pdcp was originally a rewrite of IBM dsh(1) by Jim Garlick
<garlick@llnl.gov> on LLNL's ASCI Blue-Pacific IBM SP system.  
It is now also used on Linux clusters at LLNL.

.SH "LIMITATIONS"
When using 
.B ssh 
for remote execution, stderr of ssh to be folded in with that of the
remote command.  When invoked by pdcp, it is not possible for ssh to
prompt for confirmation if a host key changes, prompt for passwords if
RSA keys are not configured properly, etc..  Finally, the connect
timeout is only adjustable with ssh when the underlying ssh implementation
supports it, and pdsh has been built to use the correct option.
